## What is PATCH?
PATCH is a rock-solid, professional, all-in-one, smart and clean solution for managing your game's updates!

Your players can finally update their copies of your game with no pain or headaches, without having to download the whole game again when a new version comes. This will save them a lot of bandwidth and time!

## Why this repository?
This repository is intended to be used for issues tracking, wiki and shared material/knowledge about PATCH. Also this will allow the community to better interact with me and communicate/report issues.
